## Ülesanne 1: Refaktoreerimine + uued nõuded
* Tänase tunni ülesanne:
   * Tutvu olemasoleva koodiga
   * Refaktoreeri kood
   * Lisa uus funktsionaalsus
   * Kontrolli, et kõik nõuded (uued ja vanad) töötavad korrektselt.

* New requirements:
  * Individuals holding a driver's license for less than a year are ineligible to rent.
  * If the driver's license has been held for less than two years, the rental price is increased by 30%.
  * If the driver's license has been held for less than three years, then an additional 15 euros will be added to the daily rental price during high season.

* Reminder/cheatsheet for refactoring
   * Use meaningful names for variables, functions and classes.
   * Use consistent indentation.
   * Separate long functions into smaller parts.
   * Remove magic numbers - create constants.
   * Remove unused or unnecessary code.
   * Last but not least: Your code should still work after the refactoring!

## Ülesanne 2: Unit testimine 
* Tänase tunni ülesandeks on unit testimine. 
* Kata oma refaktoreeritud kood unit testidega
   * Lisa projekti jest `npm install jest`
   * Dokumentatsioon: https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
   * Lisa vastav osa `package.json`-i:
   ```
   "scripts": {
      "test": "jest"
   }
   ```
   * Testide jooksutamine `npx jest` 
   * Testide jooksutamine analüüsiga `npx jest --coverage`
* Kata testidega 100% koodist

## Ülesanne 3: TDD
* Tänase tunni ülesandeks on paarisprogrammeerimine ja TDD.
   * Palun jagunege paaridesse ja võtke üks versioon Car Rental refaktoreeritud ja testitud koodist
   * Lisage uus funktsionaalsus kasutades TDD-d.
  
* Weekday/Weekend Pricing:
    * Write tests to ensure that pricing is different for weekdays and weekends. Write tests to verify correctly determined price based on the rental period.
    * Implement functionality to have different pricing for weekdays and weekends. Weekdays have regular price and weekend days have 5% price increase.
    * Example 1: 50 year old driver rents a car for three days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - Total price $150
    * Example 2: 50 year old driver rents a car for three days: Thursday, Friday, Saturday - Total price $152.50
 
* Töö jaotus: 
   * Üks partneritest kirjutab testi. 
   * Teine kirjutab koodi, et test läbi läheks.
